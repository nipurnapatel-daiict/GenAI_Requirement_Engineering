# GenAI_Requirement_Engineering
This repository contains a comprehensive case study on applying Generative AI (GenAI) techniques to Requirements Engineering, conducted as part of the IT561: Advanced Software Engineering course at DA-IICT, Gandhinagar.

ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
The project focuses on the development of a market-driven system for NYU Insurance, aiming to digitize various business processes and enhance the agent-insurer relationship. The primary objectives include:

Identifying and prioritizing system requirements through stakeholder analysis.

Developing user stories adhering to the INVEST framework.

Implementing a GenAI-powered pipeline to automate user story generation and validation.

Evaluating the effectiveness of LLMs in Requirements Engineering tasks using the RUST questionnaire.

ðŸ“Œ Key Components
Part A: Stakeholder Identification & User Stories
Manual identification of stakeholders and end-users.

Development of user stories adhering to the INVEST framework.

Prioritization using techniques like MoSCoW and AHP.
Theee AI

Part B: GenAI Pipeline Implementation
Design and implementation of a pipeline utilizing LLMs such as Deepseek-r1, Llama 3.2, Phi 4, and Mistral.

Integration with LangChain and Ollama for model interaction.

Generation and validation of user stories through the pipeline.

Inclusion of screenshots and user manuals for clarity.

Part C: Analysis & Evaluation
Assessment of LLM-generated user stories for syntactic and semantic correctness.

Evaluation using the RUST (Readable, Understandable, Specific, Technical) questionnaire.

Comparison between manually developed and AI-generated user stories.

ðŸ“Š Evaluation Metrics
The project utilizes the RUST framework to evaluate the quality of user stories:

Readable: Assessing grammar, spelling, and clarity.

Understandable: Evaluating semantic accuracy and comprehensibility.

Specific: Determining the specificity and completeness of information.

Technical: Analyzing technical accuracy and adherence to best practices.
